Hello and welcome to my blog. 

My name is Alexis Tio and I am a Game Developer from the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­! I have worked professionally as a programmer for several local studios for around ten years now. I focus mostly on Unity development but I am also able to work with other game engines such as Unreal Engine.

Throughout my career, I have learned many things. Most of my struggles stem from the lack of articles and tutorials on specific matters involving game development. That's why I decided to create this blog so I can write about those struggles and provide ample information for the people who are struggling with the same things as I did. I hope people will find the information within this blog helpful.

This blog was created in a few minutes using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). If you're a programmer and wants to have a simple and quick blog set up, I highly recommend using it and following [Barry Clark's amazing guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) on how to set it up.
