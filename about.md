I am a Game Developer from the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ with a professional career of over ten years. I primarily use Unity for Game Development although I also have experience with other game engines such as Unreal Engine, Cocos2D, and PixiJS to name a few.

I am well-versed in the following languages:
- C#
- C++
- Java
- Javascript
- Haxe
- Python
- bash/cli

This blog will contain mostly things that I have learned across my career - things that I have found interest or difficulty the first time I encountered them - in hopes that it may help other people as well.

### More Information

- I like computers and video games
- I enjoy Japanese media (e.g. music, manga)
- I enjoy documenting the things that I have learned
- I do game development for a hobby on top of my career
